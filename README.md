# AppShortcutView

There are three different types of app shortcuts:
Static Shortcuts is a type of shortcut which provides you generic links to your application.
Dynamic Shortcuts provides links to a specific, context-sensitive actions within your app.
Pinned Shortcuts (only available on Android 8 / API 26 and higher). This type of shortcut allows you to have separated home screen icons for individual shortcuts.

Maximum we can use 4 or 5 shortcut icons if it exceeds then app will get crash.
